[SESSION BOOTSTRAP — R.A.R.E. Award Website]

You are continuing an in-progress project. Read the attached spec thoroughly.

GOAL TODAY: Generate exactly one file: 
→ TARGET FILE: "C:\Newco\RARE Awards\rare_award\js\main.js"

RULES:
- Do not change any HTML IDs or classes. Do not add new external dependencies.
- Use vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). No jQuery.
- Keep functions modular, with clear init() entry points where appropriate.
- Include minimal inline comments for future maintainers.
- If the spec mentions accessibility (ARIA, keyboard), implement it.

CONTEXT:
- Design: Gold #D4AF37, Navy #1e3a5f; Fonts: Inter + Playfair Display.
- Site pages: index.html, nominate.html, policy.html, success.html.
- This repo already contains /js and /css folders.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the full source code for the target file in one code block.
- Do not include explanations or extra prose.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (you must satisfy these):
- All features for this file in the attached spec are implemented.
- The code does not throw errors if another module is temporarily missing (fail-safe imports/guards).
- The module does not modify DOM structure beyond what’s necessary (adds/removes classes only).
- Names are descriptive and consistent (e.g., initNavigation, initFormHandler, etc.)

When you’re ready, produce the code now.
